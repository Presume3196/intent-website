            <h1 class="highlight">What is Intentional Fitness?</h1>
            <p>We are a one-of-a-kind training program that is built specifically for YOU. We believe that
              fitness is a vital piece of improving and maintaining your health. There are so many ways to go
              about getting in shape, endless factors that affect your capabilities, and too much
              misinformation out there that can harm rather than help.</p>
            <p>Without intention, you will lack a clear strategy for success and lose motivation before you
              reach your goals â€“ if you set one at all! Intentionally going about fitness looks like knowing your
              limits, taking advantage of the tools available to you, setting clear goals, and working with a
              trainer who will help you with form, accountability, and direction.</p>
            <p><em>It is only with intention that you will accomplish your goals.</em></p>

            <p>Aaron Lim is a Certified Personal Trainer, Licensed Paramedic, Performance Enhancement
              Specialist, Certified Nutritionist, and Certified USA Weightlifting Coach with a degree in Biological
              Sciences from UC Irvine.</p>
            <p>Aaron knows that fitness can be intimidating, especially for anyone with little to no experience
              or mobility concerns. He strives to provide an ideal atmosphere for each and every client, so
              you can align your intentions with strategies for success. This includes keeping the training
              session fun, rotating in new workouts to keep you engaged, providing an energy that aligns
              with yours, thoughtfully selecting the necessary equipment, and remaining nearby to ensure
              safety in all movements.</p>
            <p>Everyone has a unique background, which means there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fitness.
              Aaron takes time to get to know you, understand your needs and desires, and go over a plan
              proposal before every program begins. This helps you and Aaron get on the same page and
              ensures you are 100% comfortable with every aspect of the routine.</p>
            <p>When Aaron isn't intentionally creating fitness regimens and training clients, he is likely
              jamming to country music; attending Dodger games; spending time with his pup, Scully; playing
              tennis and hockey, or exploring local cuisine.</p>
